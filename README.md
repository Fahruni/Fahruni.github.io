## Projects

### [**Coffee Sales Analysis**]([https://github.com/Fahruni/Coffee-Sales-Analysis](https://fahruni.github.io/Coffee-Sales-Analysis)
This project aimed to analyse coffee sales pattern throughout 2019 until 2022 which happened in United States, United Kingdom, and Ireland. The data itself was processed by using **Microsoft Excel** and finalised into a dashboard. In the project, I showcased my skill by using Microsoft Excel's feature & function such as; pivot table, timeline, `IF` statement, `INDEX`, `MATCH`, and `XLOOKUP`.

### [**Worldwide Layoffs Exploratory Data Analysis**](https://github.com/Fahruni/Worldwide-Layoffs-Exploratory)
The analysis involves exploring datasets containing information about worldwide layoffs that happened mainly during 2021 to 2022. The data exploration itself was controlled by 12 questions that I designed meticulously in order to find wide range of answers. I showed my skill and proficiency in *SQL* (**MySQL**) by making queries which contained various statement, clause and function such as `INSERT`, `UPDATE`, `AVG`, `HAVING`, `JOIN`, etc.
